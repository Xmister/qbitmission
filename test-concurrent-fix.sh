echo "   - Global qBTConn variable shared across all HTTP requests"
echo "   - Multiple clients caused race conditions and crashes"
echo "   - Authentication state was corrupted"

echo "Key changes made:"
echo "- Removed global qBTConn variable from main.go"
echo "- Modified handler() to create new connection per request"
echo "- Updated all functions to accept connection parameter"
echo "- Added test mode support for proper testing"
echo "- Updated Dockerfile to apply patches during build"
